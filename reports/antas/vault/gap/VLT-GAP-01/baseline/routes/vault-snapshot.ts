/**
 * routes/vault-snapshot.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Feature 15 — Encrypted Full Vault Snapshot Export.
 * Feature 15b — Stored Vault Backups (server-side backup store).
 * Feature 15c — Automatic Vault Backups + Restore Preview/Merge.
 *
 * One-click download of the caller's ENTIRE vault (Vault entities, Local
 * accounts, KYC entities, Game entities, Wallets, and — optionally, since
 * it can be large — Attachments) as a single AES-256-GCM-encrypted blob,
 * protected by a password the user chooses at export time (never the
 * account password, never stored anywhere — same "prove you have it, we
 * never keep it" principle as every other Vault credential in this app).
 *
 * This is different from Feature 13's GET /vault/export
 * (routes/vault-migration.ts): that one produces a portable, UNencrypted
 * CSV/JSON of Vault entities only, meant for moving data between tools.
 * This one is a full-fidelity, encrypted disaster-recovery backup of every
 * table this app stores secrets in.
 *
 * Feature 15b: every export used to only stream the blob to the browser —
 * nothing was kept anywhere, so a lost download meant a lost backup and
 * there was never a way to see what backups existed. Every export now ALSO
 * writes a row to vault_snapshots (lib/db/src/schema/vault-snapshots.ts), so
 * backups are actually stored *in the vault* and can be listed, re-downloaded,
 * restored from, renamed, or deleted from the Snapshot Backup page — the
 * browser download still happens too, for anyone who wants an offline copy.
 * The most recent MAX_STORED_SNAPSHOTS per user are kept; older ones are
 * pruned automatically on each new export.
 *
 * Feature 15c: the payload-building + storage logic below
 * (buildVaultSnapshotPayload / storeSnapshotRow) is factored out of the POST
 * /vault/snapshot/export handler so lib/vault-backup-schedule-cron.ts can
 * build and store the exact same snapshot shape on a timer, just encrypted
 * under the server-managed envelope key (lib/vault-backup-envelope.ts)
 * instead of a user-typed password. `source` ("manual" | "scheduled") and
 * `encryptionMode` ("password" | "envelope") on vault_snapshots record which
 * path produced a given row, and `checksum` (sha256 of the stored blob) lets
 * a corruption check confirm a stored/delivered copy matches what was
 * originally written.
 *
 * Key derivation (manual/password mode): scrypt(password, salt, 32) — same
 * primitive already used for wallet seed-phrase encryption elsewhere in this
 * codebase (routes/vault.ts's SEED_KEY), just with a random per-export salt
 * instead of a fixed one, since here the "key" is a user-chosen password
 * rather than a server secret.
 *
 * Blob format (all fields base64, colon-joined):
 *   AYZENBAK1:<salt>:<iv>:<authTag>:<ciphertext>   (password mode, legacy —
 *                                                    scrypt at Node's default
 *                                                    cost; decrypt-only, kept
 *                                                    so old exports still
 *                                                    restore)
 *   AYZENBAK2:<salt>:<iv>:<authTag>:<ciphertext>   (password mode, current —
 *                                                    scrypt at a hardened
 *                                                    cost, see SCRYPT_V2_COST)
 *   ENV1:<version>:<iv>:<authTag>:<ciphertext>     (envelope mode — see
 *                                                    lib/vault-backup-envelope.ts)
 *
 * Storing the blob server-side adds no new secret exposure: it's already
 * AES-256-GCM ciphertext under a secret AYZEN doesn't keep in the clear
 * (a password it never sees again, or an envelope key wrapped under
 * VAULT_MASTER_KEY), so a vault_snapshots row is exactly as unreadable as a
 * downloaded .ayzenbak file would be.

// Route Integration Roadmap — Season E, Phase E6: new resource builder.
// `vault_snapshots` has one owner column (`user_id`) — same plain
// single-owner shape as every other `*Resource` in this series. Every
// route below already scoped its own query by `eq(vaultSnapshotsTable.id,
// id), eq(vaultSnapshotsTable.userId, userId)` (or the trash-purge
// variant with an extra `isNotNull(deletedAt)`), just never through PEP.
//
// The builder itself deliberately does NOT filter on `deletedAt` — it
// only resolves "who owns this row" (Guide's Step 2: "exactly one DB
// read... resolves one fact"), regardless of trashed state. The
// trashed-vs-live distinction stays exactly where it already lived, in
// each handler's own more specific query (download/PATCH/DELETE require
// `deletedAt IS NULL`; restore/purge require `deletedAt IS NOT NULL`) —
// same "PEP additive, handler's own logic untouched" posture this whole
// series uses. A caller who owns a snapshot but hits the wrong trashed
// state still gets exactly the same pre-existing 404 as before, just from
// the handler's own query instead of the gate.
//
// Two of the five pre-existing handlers (download, PATCH, DELETE, restore,
// purge) had their own `Number.isFinite(id)` check ahead of any DB call,
// replying `400 { error: "Invalid snapshot id" }` for a non-numeric id —
// a different body from the "not found" 404. The plain sentinel-and-onDeny
// shape would collapse that into the same 404 as every other deny reason,
// changing behavior for that one case. Same fix as Phase C11's
// `requireAyzenMailboxMessageOwnershipStrictId`: a "strict id" wrapper

// Shared by restore-preview/restore below: pull the decrypted snapshot JSON
// out of either an uploaded blob or a stored snapshot row, given a password.
// Envelope-mode (scheduled) stored snapshots decrypt with the server key
// instead — no password needed, since nobody was present to set one.
//
// Vault Backup hardening, Round 4 — envelope mode is stored-row-only now.
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// This used to accept a client-supplied `blob` for EITHER mode, and decide
// which decrypt path to use by sniffing its prefix. That was a real
// cross-tenant hole for envelope mode specifically: it has no password at
// all, so given a copy of ANY user's "ENV1:..." blob — obtained any way at
// all (a support ticket, a misdirected delivery, a DB export, someone
// pasting it somewhere) — a different authenticated user could decrypt it
// by POSTing it here under their OWN account. Password mode never had this
// problem (the attacker would still need the export password), but
// envelope mode's "key" is a shared server secret nobody types, so blob
// possession alone was sufficient.
//
// Fix: a client-supplied `blob` is now ONLY ever treated as password mode.
// Envelope-mode snapshots can only be restored via `snapshotId`, which is
// looked up through a query already filtered to `userId` — i.e. only ever
// the caller's own row — before anything gets decrypted. (Layer 2 of this
// fix, AAD-binding new envelope blobs to their owning userId, lives in
// lib/vault-backup-envelope.ts; that's defense-in-depth for this same class
// of bug, not a substitute for this check.)
