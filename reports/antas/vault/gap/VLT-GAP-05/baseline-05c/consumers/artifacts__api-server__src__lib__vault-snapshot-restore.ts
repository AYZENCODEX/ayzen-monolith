/**
 * lib/vault-snapshot-restore.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Feature 15c — Vault Snapshot Restore: Preview + Merge.
 *
 * routes/vault-snapshot.ts's original POST /vault/snapshot/restore only ever
 * restored Vault entities, and inserted them unconditionally — running it
 * twice on the same backup duplicated every entry, despite the route's own
 * comment claiming it was "safe to run more than once". This module replaces
 * that with a real MERGE across every table the snapshot actually contains
 * (see the `snapshot` shape built in routes/vault-snapshot.ts's POST
 * /vault/snapshot/export): Vault entities, Local accounts, KYC entities,
 * Game entities, and Wallets. For each table, a row already present (same
 * identity key) is left untouched, and only genuinely missing rows are
 * inserted. Nothing is ever updated or deleted — restore stays additive.
 *
 * Feature 15d extends this the same way: Mail Folders, Labels, Rules,
 * Contacts, Templates (body_html re-encrypted on insert, same convention as
 * the Vault's own sensitive fields), Messages (text_body/html_body
 * re-encrypted; identity key is the RFC message_id), Task Submissions,
 * Joined Protocols, and Protocol Ratings all merge-restore the same
 * additive way. Protocol Enrollments (project_enrollments) is backed up
 * (see routes/vault-snapshot.ts) but NOT auto-restored — its vault_entry_id
 * is NOT NULL and points at a Vault Entity row whose id changes on every
 * merge-restore, with no safe remap yet (same reasoning as `entityCoverage`
 * below). Task Submissions' own entity_id/entity_ids/cost_entries fields
 * have the identical problem but are nullable, so those three columns are
 * simply dropped on insert rather than excluding the whole table — see the
 * comment on the `taskSubmissions` RAW_PLANS entry. Finance and the account
 * profile are backed up (see routes/vault-snapshot.ts) but deliberately NOT
 * auto-restored here — see the `finance`/`profile` comment in that file for
 * why.
 *
 * Feature 15e adds Wallet Hub coverage: Built-in Wallet Tokens (key:
 * symbol) and Chain Deposits (key: chain + tx_hash + log_index — the
 * table's own real DB uniqueness constraint) merge-restore the same
 * additive way. Wallet Transfers, Credits, and Credit Transactions are
 * backed up but NOT auto-restored — same reasoning as Finance: these are
 * live balances and two-party money movements, not something a restore
 * should silently rewrite.
 *
 * Feature 15h adds full Local/Vault/KYC/Game entity coverage: KYC Data
 * Entities (kyc_data_entities — key: name + father_name + birth_date,
 * nid_number re-encrypted on insert, same convention as mail
 * templates/messages) merge-restore the same additive way. Category
 * receipts, value history, and entity shares (vault_shares, both granted
 * and received) are backed up (see routes/vault-snapshot.ts) but
 * deliberately NOT auto-restored — see the `entityCoverage` comment in that
 * file for why (entity-id remapping + shares being two-party data).
 *
 * Attachments are intentionally NOT restored here (same as the original
 * code): they're informational in the snapshot, shown in the preview counts
 * if you want to add them, but there's no dedicated attachment-recreate path
 * since vault-attachments.ts's upload flow expects a real file upload, not a
 * base64 blob replay.
 *
 * Two entry points:
 *   - buildRestoreDiff(userId, snapshot) — read-only. Computes what would be
 *     added per table, with a small NON-SENSITIVE preview list (display
 *     names only — never passwords/2FA/backup codes/seed phrases), and
 *     returns counts. Powers POST /vault/snapshot/restore-preview.
 *   - applyRestoreDiff(userId, snapshot) — recomputes the SAME diff from
 *     scratch server-side (never trusts a diff computed on an earlier
 *     request, or anything the client could supply) and inserts only the
 *     missing rows, all tables in one DB transaction. Powers POST
 *     /vault/snapshot/restore.
 *
 * Identity keys (what makes two rows "the same" for merge purposes) are
 * heuristic, since none of these tables has a real uniqueness constraint
 * across their user-facing fields:
 *   - vault         → projectName (case-insensitive) — the same field the
 *                     original restore already required to be present.
 *   - wallets       → chain + address (address case-insensitive).
 *   - localAccounts → category + username + email
 *   - kycEntries    → category + platform + username + email
 *   - gameEntries   → category + username + email
 * A row with every key field blank can never collide with anything, so it's
 * always treated as "new" rather than silently dropped.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS TO VERIFY (I built this from routes/vault-snapshot.ts,
 * lib/vault-crypto.ts, routes/local-accounts.ts, routes/kyc.ts and
 * routes/game-entries.ts — I did not have lib/wallet-crypto.ts or the
 * vaultEntriesTable/walletsTable drizzle schema files themselves):
 *   1. `encryptPhrase` — I'm assuming lib/wallet-crypto.ts exports an
 *      `encryptPhrase(plaintext): string` counterpart to the `decryptPhrase`
 *      it's already known to export (imported in routes/vault-snapshot.ts).
 *      If the real export is named differently, fix the dynamic import
 *      inside insertWalletRow() below.
 *   2. `db.transaction(async (tx) => { ... })` — standard drizzle-orm API;
 *      assuming this project's db instance supports it (not exercised
 *      anywhere else in the files I was given). If it doesn't, drop the
 *      `db.transaction` wrapper in applyRestoreDiff() and call the insert
 *      helpers directly against `db` — restore just loses atomicity across
 *      tables (a failure partway through would leave earlier tables' rows
 *      committed), which is a reasonable fallback for an additive-only
 *      operation.
 *   3. Raw-table column exclusion lists (excludeOnInsert) are my best guess
 *      at which columns are foreign keys / server-generated vs. safe to
 *      copy — double check against the real local_accounts / kyc_entries /
 *      game_entries table definitions (migrations 0xx) before relying on
 *      this in production.
