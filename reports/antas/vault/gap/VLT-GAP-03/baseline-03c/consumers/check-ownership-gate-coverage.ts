 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Route Integration Roadmap — Season C, Phase C33 (Pattern documentation +
 * CI lint guard), part 2 of 2. Part 1 is
 * `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/policy/OWNERSHIP_GATING_GUIDE.md` — read
 * that first if you're deciding how to gate a new route; this file only
 * enforces the convention, it doesn't explain it.
 *
 * ── Why C19A-C32 stayed manual audits ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Nothing anywhere in this codebase ever REQUIRED a new `:id` route to go
 * through `requireOwnership()`/`authorizeMany()` — every route in this
 * series got gated because a human, phase by phase, grepped for
 * `router\.(get|post|patch|delete)\("[^"]*:id` and manually checked each
 * hit. That works for a one-time sweep; it does nothing to stop the NEXT
 * ungated `:id` route from shipping. This script is that stop.
 *
 * ── What this checks, precisely ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * For every `router.<verb>("path", ...middleware, handler)` call in every
 * `routes/*.ts` file, where `path` contains a `:param` segment: is one of
 * the following true?
 *   1. One of the middleware arguments is itself a direct call to a known
 *      PEP wiring function (`requireOwnership`, `requirePermission`,
 *      `requirePolicy`, `requireRole`, `requireStepUp`, `requireApproval`,
 *      `authorizeMany` — the full `lib/policy/pep/*` surface), OR
 *   2. One of the middleware arguments is a call to a function DEFINED
 *      ANYWHERE IN `routes/*.ts` whose own body contains a call to one of
 *      those same names — the "thin wrapper" pattern
 *      (`requireVaultEntryOwnership`, `requireLocalAccountOwnership`, etc.)
 *      every migrated file in this series uses (see the GUIDE's "Wiring it
 *      up" section). This is repo-wide, not same-file-only, because
 *      several of these wrappers are themselves imported across files —
 *      e.g. `value-history.ts` imports and calls `local-accounts.ts`'s own
 *      `requireLocalAccountOwnership` directly, same as `exchange-api.ts`
 *      imports `kyc.ts`'s exported `requireKycEntryOwnership` (see
 *      `test-route-ownership-regression.ts`'s header for that same
 *      distinction). A same-file-only check would wrongly flag both as
 *      unwired. This does NOT trace actual `import` statements (name-based
 *      matching across the whole `routes/` directory is enough for this
 *      codebase's naming convention — every wrapper name so far is unique
 *      to one definition) — see "Known limitations" below for what that
 *      trades away.
 * If neither holds, the route is flagged as an "unwired param route".
 *
 * This is deliberately a SHAPE check, not a correctness check — it cannot
 * tell you the resource builder resolves the right column, or that the
 * `onDeny` body is the right one. That's still code review's job (and
 * `test-route-ownership-regression.ts`'s, for the two builders it can
 * reach — see that file's own header for why it can't reach everything
 * this script can see).
 *
 * ── Baseline: grandfather what already exists, block what's new ───────────
 * At the time this script shipped, `routes/` had unwired param routes that
 * predate this check by anywhere from one to dozens of phases — some
 * genuinely need a resource builder still (C33's own follow-up batch, see
 * `OWNERSHIP_GATING_GUIDE.md`), some are deliberately public/decision-
 * pending (`GET /projects/:id/dates` — C29, still awaiting owner sign-off),
 * some aren't ownership-shaped at all (admin-only `:id` routes gated by
 * `requireAdmin`/role instead). Failing CI today on all of those would
 * block unrelated work over a backlog this ONE phase was never scoped to
 * clear (that's C33's follow-up batch's job, and partly C28/C29's
 * decision-gated job). So: every unwired param route found at baseline-
 * generation time is written to `ownership-gate-baseline.json` next to this
 * file. A future run only fails for an unwired param route that is NOT in
 * that file — i.e. a genuinely NEW gap. Baseline entries for routes that
 * get properly wired later simply stop matching anything and go stale;
 * `--update-baseline` (below) drops stale entries automatically, so the
 * baseline only ever shrinks unless someone deliberately adds a new
 * ungated route (which is exactly the case this script exists to catch).
 *
 * ── Usage ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   tsx scripts/src/check-ownership-gate-coverage.ts
 *     Fails (exit 1) if any unwired param route is NOT in the baseline.
 *     Prints every such route, plus a summary of baseline/new/total counts.
 *
 *   tsx scripts/src/check-ownership-gate-coverage.ts --update-baseline
 *     Regenerates `ownership-gate-baseline.json` from the CURRENT unwired
 *     set (drops stale entries for routes that got wired or removed, adds
 *     any new ones found). Run this deliberately, in its own commit, when
 *     you've reviewed a newly-flagged route and decided it's an accepted
 *     gap (not by reflex to make a failing check pass — see the GUIDE).
 *
 * ── Known limitations (false negatives this script CANNOT see) ────────────
 * - A wrapper name reused for two unrelated definitions in different files
 *   (none exist today — see above) would let one satisfy the other's
 *   routes. The `--update-baseline` review step is the backstop: a newly-
 *   flagged route that's actually wired via a real, distinctly-named
 *   wrapper will show up, get inspected, and either turns out genuinely
 *   unwired (fix it) or reveals a naming collision worth renaming on its
 *   own merits.
 * - Wiring two calls deep (a wrapper that calls a second local function
 *   that itself calls `requireOwnership`) is invisible — `collectCalledNames`
 *   only looks at the wrapper's own body, one level. No file in this
 *   codebase nests that deep today (see that function's own comment).
 * - A route gated by ownership logic OUTSIDE the `requireOwnership()`/
 *   `authorizeMany()` family entirely (raw SQL `WHERE ... AND user_id =`,
 *   same as most of the C27 bulk-family routes before that phase) is
 *   correctly SAFE but will still show as "unwired" by this script's own
 *   definition — this script only checks for PDP/PEP wiring, not for
 *   ownership-safety by any means. That's intentional (see the GUIDE for
 *   why raw-SQL scoping and PDP wiring are different, both-valid layers)
 *   — such routes land in the baseline like any other pre-existing gap,
 *   not because they're insecure, but because this script has no way to
 *   verify hand-written SQL is correctly scoped. Confirming that is still
 *   a code-review judgment call.
 *
 * ── Season D, Phase D8 update — three detection gaps closed ───────────────
 * D1-D7 (Route Integration Roadmap, Season D) triaged this script's own
 * baseline by hand and found ~99 routes that were already safely gated but
 * showed up as "unwired" only because this script couldn't see the shape —
 * not because the route was actually a gap. Three shapes, each documented
 * in its own phase's CHANGES file:
 *
 *   1. Bare (uncalled) platform-role middleware — `router.patch(path,
 *      requireAdmin, handler)`, not `requireAdmin(...)`. The original
 *      `isWired()` only ever inspected `ts.isCallExpression(arg)`, so a
 *      middleware reference passed BARE (no parens — `requireAdmin`,
 *      `requireDev` in `middlewares/auth.ts` are ordinary Express
 *      middleware functions, not factories) was invisible. See D3's
 *      `projects.ts`/`tasks.ts` findings (bucket ক, 9 routes) —
 *      `PEP_WIRING_BARE_IDENTIFIERS` below.
 *   2. `requireRoles(...)` — a role-middleware FACTORY (`middlewares/
 *      auth.ts`), a different name from `requireRole` (singular,
 *      `lib/policy/pep/middleware.ts`) that was already in
 *      `PEP_WIRING_NAMES`. Same D3 finding, same fix class — just added to
 *      the existing call-expression name set.
 *   3. Inline handler-body wiring — a decision made INSIDE the route
 *      handler, not as a router-level middleware argument at all. Two
 *      distinct sub-shapes, both found by D1's `teams.ts` triage and
 *      confirmed repeated in `finance-invoices.ts` (D2), `tasks.ts` (D3),
 *      and `teams.ts`'s own D6 conversion (`createGroupMembershipRule()`,
 *      42 routes):
 *        (a) `const x = await authorize({ engine, action, resource });
 *             if (x.decision.effect !== "ALLOW") { res.status(4xx)...;
 *             return; }` — real PDP enforcement, just not expressed as a
 *             router-middleware call (every route in this shape needed
 *             something else — a 400 body check, a different resource's
 *             404, or an already-fetched row's column — to run FIRST; see
 *             `teams.ts`'s own header for why). `handlerHasInlineWiring()`
 *             below looks for the `.decision.effect` comparison itself —
 *             that property path is unique to a real PDP decision object
 *             (D7's AUDIT-only `authorize()` wrapper calls, e.g. `finance.
 *             ts`'s `auditFinanceOwnership()`, deliberately discard the
 *             return value and never check `.decision.effect` — so they do
 *             NOT match this and correctly stay in the baseline; audit-only
 *             wiring adds observability, not a gate, and this script's job
 *             is to find gates).
 *        (b) `if (req.user!.role !== "admin" && ... ) { res.status(4xx)...;
 *             return; }` — a hand-rolled platform-role check with NO
 *             `requireAdmin`-style middleware at all (D1's `teams.ts`
 *             bucket ক, 4 routes; also present standalone in `credits.ts`).
 *             Recognized only when it's actually gating (the `if`-branch
 *             calls `res.status(401` or `res.status(403`), to avoid
 *             matching an incidental `role !== "..."` comparison used for
 *             something other than access control.
 *      Neither sub-shape is traced back to a specific PolicyEngine/rule
 *      registration — that would require resolving `registerRule()` call
 *      sites back to their `authorize({engine: ...})` call sites across the
 *      file, real semantic analysis this script's AST-only, syntax-level
 *      design (see header above) deliberately doesn't do. The `.decision.
 *      effect` check is a proxy: every inline `authorize()` call in this
 *      codebase that gates (as opposed to just audits) checks that field,
 *      so matching the field is equivalent to matching "this call is a
 *      gate" without needing to resolve which engine backs it.
 *
 * `--update-baseline` after this fix drops every route in these three
 * shapes from `ownership-gate-baseline.json` (they were never actually
 * gaps) without changing what the script MEANS by "wired" — still only the
 * `requireOwnership()`/`authorizeMany()` PDP family (directly, via a
 * router-level bare/called middleware reference, or via an inline
 * `authorize()` call whose result actually gates the response) plus the
 * pre-existing legacy platform-role middleware this update also recognizes.
 * Raw-SQL ownership scoping and audit-only `authorize()` wiring (D7) are
 * still, deliberately, NOT recognized — see "Known limitations" above,
 * which this update does not change.
 *
 * ── Enforcement Roadmap, Track H, Phases H1/H2 update ─────────────────────
 * H1 (CI enforcement): this script was already a step in `security.yml`,
 * but the baseline had silently drifted — by the time H1 ran, 41 param
 * routes existed that were in neither the baseline nor a wired shape, so the
 * step was red. Two changes make the gate trustworthy rather than just
 * present:
 *   1. Local alias resolution (see `collectBareAliases`): `const admin =
 *      requireAdmin;` followed by `router.put(path, admin, handler)` is the
 *      exact D8 "bare platform-role middleware" shape, just under a local
 *      name (`sub-engines.ts`). The D8 check matched the literal identifier
 *      only, so aliased use looked unwired. Resolved per-file, top-level
 *      `const X = <known bare identifier>` only — no data-flow analysis.
 *   2. Every run now prints (and, under GitHub Actions, writes to
 *      `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`) the baseline trend: baseline size, current
 *      unwired count, new, stale. The number is visible in every CI run
 *      instead of living in an unread JSON file.
 * H2 (burn-down): `--report` prints the current unwired set grouped by
 * domain with a SIGNAL per route — a text-level heuristic, NOT a security
 * verdict — so the burn-down can be worked highest-risk first:
 *   - `hand-scoped`   handler body filters on the session user id
 *                     (`user_id = ...`, `eq(x.userId, ...)`) or a local
 *                     membership/access helper — safe-looking, needs a
 *                     human to confirm and (optionally) add the PDP layer;
 *   - `no-scope-signal` none of the above found — review these FIRST;
 *   - `role-gated`    handler/inline role check the shape detector already
 *                     accepts elsewhere but this route missed.
 * The report never changes the pass/fail result and never edits the
 * baseline; `--update-baseline` remains the only writer.
 *
 * No `node_modules`/DB/network dependency — this only parses `.ts` source
 * text with the TypeScript compiler API (same syntax-only approach
 * `check-all.ts` already uses), so it runs anywhere this repo's source is
 * checked out.

 * Route Integration Roadmap — Phase F1 (Public Route Audit Wiring).
 *
 * `requirePublicAudit()` (lib/policy/pep/middleware.ts) is deliberately NOT
 * added to `PEP_WIRING_NAMES` above — see that set's own header on the D7
 * finding: "audit-only wiring adds observability, not a gate, and this
 * script's job is to find gates". `requirePublicAudit()` is audit-only by
 * construction (no deny path exists — see its own header) for routes that
 * have no ownership/role fact to check in the first place (access is
 * already fully gated by URL token/code possession). Counting it as
 * "wired" here would blur exactly the distinction the D7 note already
 * drew for `auditFinanceOwnership()`-style calls.
 *
 * So it gets its own, third bucket — neither "wired" (a real gate exists)
 * nor "unwired" (nothing has looked at this route at all, needs review/
 * baseline entry): a route calling `requirePublicAudit()` is a REVIEWED,
 * permanently-accepted "no gate needed, but observable" case, self-
 * evident from the source line itself. It is excluded from BOTH the
 * `wired` count and the `unwired`/baseline set — no baseline entry
 * needed or wanted for it (unlike the pre-F1 admin/decision-pending gaps
 * baseline exists for), since the `requirePublicAudit(...)` call at the
 * route is itself the durable record of "this was reviewed and is
 * intentionally public" — a baseline entry would only add staleness risk
 * (see FINDINGS_PHASE_F1_PUBLIC_ROUTE_AUDIT.md for the reviewed list).
