 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 3, Phase 5a-a: Client Library Setup.
 *
 * "Install/configure the existing OIDC client approach" — this file is
 * that installation. It is a GENERIC, reusable Authorization Code + PKCE
 * client toolkit: PKCE pair generation, `state` generation, an authorize
 * URL builder, and a token-exchange call. It knows nothing about Sylo,
 * AYZEN's central issuer, or any specific `client_id`/`redirect_uri` —
 * every one of those is a parameter, not a constant in this file. This is
 * deliberate: Sylo is the first of five first-party apps
 * (`seed-oidc-clients.ts`, Phase 2B: sylo/ryft/wisp/verve/zynth) that will
 * eventually go through this exact same client setup, the same
 * "add one more entry, nothing else in this file changes" shape
 * `subdomain-app.ts`'s own header already established for the subdomain
 * split.
 *
 * WHY HAND-ROLLED, NOT AN INSTALLED PACKAGE ("the EXISTING approach")
 * This codebase already has exactly one precedent for a browser-redirect
 * OAuth client: `vault/infrastructure/backup/cloud.ts` (Google Drive / Dropbox
 * connect flow) — hand-rolled `fetch()` calls, no `openid-client`/
 * `oauth4webapi`/passport-family dependency anywhere in this monorepo's
 * `package.json` files. This file follows that same established house
 * approach rather than introducing a new third-party auth dependency,
 * adapted for what an OIDC PUBLIC client (see below) actually needs that
 * a confidential-client cloud-storage OAuth flow doesn't: PKCE, not a
 * client secret.
 *
 * PUBLIC CLIENT, PKCE-ONLY — NO SECRET, EVER
 * Every first-party AYZEN app (`seed-oidc-clients.ts`) is registered with
 * `client_secret_hash: null` — a public client. All five are the same
 * browser-served SPA bundle (`subdomain-app.ts`) scoped by hostname;
 * there is no server-side place to keep a confidential secret for any of
 * them, and section 3.2's PKCE requirement is that client type's proof of
 * possession instead (`lib/oidc-token-client-auth.ts`'s own header, the
 * provider side of this exact fact, already documents the identical
 * reasoning). `exchangeCodeForTokens()` below never sends a
 * `client_secret` — there is nothing to send.
 *
 * SCOPE DISCIPLINE (this is 5a-a, not 5a-b..5a-f or 5b)
 *   This file provides the MECHANISM — PKCE, state, URL-building,
 *   token exchange — generic over an `OidcClientConfig` /
 *   `OidcProviderMetadata` the CALLER supplies. It does not:
 *     - know Sylo's real issuer, client_id, or redirect_uri (5a-b/5a-c/
 *       5a-d — those sub-phases construct the actual `OidcClientConfig`
 *       value this file's functions will be called with);
 *     - fetch `/.well-known/openid-configuration` itself to populate an
 *       `OidcProviderMetadata` (5a-e, "Discovery Integration" — that
 *       sub-phase's job is producing the value this file's functions
 *       accept as a parameter, not fetching it from within this file);
 *     - render a login button, redirect the browser, define a callback
 *       route, persist `codeVerifier`/`state` across the redirect
 *       round-trip, or call any of this against a real value (all of
 *       that is Phase 5b, "Sylo Login Wiring" — 5b-a..5b-g).
 *   This file is imported by nothing yet, and imports nothing Sylo- or
 *   route-specific — it is pure, framework-agnostic client logic,
 *   independently testable (5a-f) before any of it is wired to a page.
 *
 * PKCE, CONCRETELY (RFC 7636)
 *   `code_verifier`: a high-entropy random string, base64url-encoded, no
 *   padding — RFC 7636 §4.1 allows 43-128 characters; 32 random bytes
 *   base64url-encodes to 43, the shortest RFC-compliant length, which is
 *   also what Auth0/Okta's own client SDKs default to.
 *   `code_challenge`: `BASE64URL(SHA256(code_verifier))`, the `"S256"`
 *   method (RFC 7636 §4.2) — the only method this provider's own PKCE
 *   enforcement (`lib/oidc-pkce.ts`, Phase 3d) accepts; `"plain"` is
 *   never offered here.
 *   Uses the browser's native Web Crypto API (`crypto.getRandomValues`,
 *   `crypto.subtle.digest`) — available in every environment this SPA
 *   already targets, no polyfill/dependency needed.
