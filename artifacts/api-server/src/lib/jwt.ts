 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 1, Phase 1A (Crypto Foundation, part A): HS256 → RS256.
 * Verification is now kid-based and deterministic (Phase 1D-b) — see
 * decodeHeader()/tryVerifyRs256() below and resolveVerificationKeys() in
 * lib/jwt-keys.ts.
 *
 * HISTORY
 * This file used to sign tokens with HMAC-SHA256 (HS256) using a single
 * shared secret (AYZEN_JWT_SECRET) — see git history / the OIDC roadmap doc
 * for the full writeup of why that was fine for a single-codebase SPA but
 * blocks real OIDC clients (they'd need the power to forge tokens just to
 * verify them). Tokens are now signed with RS256 against an asymmetric
 * keypair resolved in lib/jwt-keys.ts: AYZEN Central Account holds the
 * private key, every verifier only ever needs the public key.
 *
 * WHAT'S STILL MISSING (later phases, not this file)
 *  - Key rotation / multiple retained public keys (Phase 1B)
 *  - GET /.well-known/jwks.json + /.well-known/openid-configuration (Phase 1B)
 *  - client registry, Authorization Code + PKCE, id_token/UserInfo (Phase 2+)
 *
 * ROLLOUT
 * Deploying this invalidates every previously-issued HS256 token by default
 * — same call the project made for the original unsigned→HS256 migration.
 * Set ALLOW_LEGACY_HS256_TOKENS=true (lib/jwt-keys.ts) for a temporary grace
 * period that also accepts old HS256 tokens; leave it off once real logins
 * have replaced old sessions (they expire within 7 days on their own).
