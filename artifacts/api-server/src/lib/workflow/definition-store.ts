 * (§16 Workflow Definition). The DB-backed counterpart to event-bus/
 * event-registry.ts's in-memory registry — see workflow_definition's own
 * migration-113 comment for why a definition is data here, not code: it
 * carries its own `version` field and is meant to be authored/edited
 * (an admin UI, in V1) rather than shipped only via a `registerX()` call
 * at process boot.
 *
 * publishDefinition() validates synchronously (same "fail at the call
 * site, not at first run" posture scheduler/job-store.ts's scheduleCron()
 * uses for parseCron()) before ever inserting a row.
