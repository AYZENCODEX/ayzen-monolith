 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * §6 — maps event types to schemas/owners/deprecation status. In-memory,
 * populated at process startup by each domain module's own registration
 * call (mirrors lib/policy/registry's "rules register themselves, the
 * registry just holds them" posture) — there is no DB table for this on
 * purpose: definitions are code, versioned with the code that publishes
 * and consumes them, not runtime-editable state. (Contrast with
 * event_outbox/event_processed/event_dead_letter, which ARE durable rows —
 * see migrations/110 — because those are per-event facts, not per-type
 * declarations.)
 *
 * §5's naming list is registered by this file's own default-registration
 * call at the bottom as a starting inventory so V1's dispatcher has
 * something real to validate against immediately; individual domain
 * modules (organizations, credits, notifications, ...) are expected to
 * take over registering their own types as they migrate onto the bus,
 * at which point their registerEvent() call is the source of truth and
 * can freely override the default's version/schema/owner here.
