 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Vault Backup hardening, Round 5 — SSRF protection for the webhook delivery
 * destination (vault/infrastructure/backup/delivery.ts / routes/vault-backup-schedule.ts).
 *
 * The problem: a vault backup schedule's `webhookUrl` is a URL an
 * authenticated user types in, and the SERVER — not the user's browser —
 * makes an outbound POST to it (carrying the encrypted backup blob) every
 * time that schedule runs. Nothing previously checked *where* that URL
 * pointed beyond "is it http(s)". A malicious or compromised account could
 * set it to an internal/private address — a cloud metadata endpoint
 * (169.254.169.254), an internal admin panel, a database's HTTP interface,
 * localhost, another container on the same network — and get the server
 * itself to make requests into places the account holder should never be
 * able to reach directly. This runs on an unattended cron schedule, so it's
 * not a one-off click either: it's a standing, repeating SSRF primitive
 * until the schedule is disabled.
 *
 * assertPublicHttpsUrl() is the guard: https-only, no embedded credentials,
 * hostname must not be a bare IP or resolve (via a real DNS lookup, not
 * just string-matching "localhost") to anything in a private/loopback/
 * link-local/reserved/multicast range — IPv4 and IPv6, including
 * IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (`::ffff:169.254.169.254`) which would
 * otherwise sail through an IPv4-only check.
 *
 * Two call sites, deliberately not one:
 *   1. routes/vault-backup-schedule.ts calls it when a schedule is saved,
 *      for immediate feedback ("that URL isn't allowed") instead of a
 *      silent failure on the next scheduled run.
 *   2. vault/infrastructure/backup/delivery.ts calls it again immediately before every
 *      actual delivery attempt. DNS answers can change after a schedule is
 *      saved (a hostname that was public last week can be repointed at an
 *      internal address today), so the save-time check alone isn't
 *      sufficient — the delivery-time check is the one that actually
 *      matters and must never be skipped, even for a schedule saved
 *      before this guard existed.
 *
 * What this does NOT fully close: a sufficiently adversarial DNS setup
 * (near-zero TTL, answers alternating between a public and a private IP on
 * successive queries) could in principle return a different address to our
 * validation lookup than to fetch()'s own internal lookup microseconds
 * later — "DNS rebinding". Fully closing that requires pinning the exact
 * validated socket address for the actual request (custom low-level
 * dispatcher/lookup), which isn't done here to avoid adding a new runtime
 * dependency for this round. What IS done — re-validating right before
 * every send, rather than only at save time, plus refusing to follow
 * redirects (see deliverSnapshotByWebhook) so a webhook target can't
 * sidestep validation entirely by 302-ing the request somewhere private —
 * closes the realistic, low-effort version of this attack (a literal
 * internal address or hostname, static DNS, or a redirect-based bypass).
 * The narrow rebinding case is a documented residual risk, not a silent one.
