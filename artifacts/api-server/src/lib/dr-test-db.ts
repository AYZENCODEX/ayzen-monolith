/**
 * lib/dr-test-db.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DR Evidence Collector — Phase 2 (schema-isolated restore).
 * See dr-evidence-collector-design.md §1 for the full design this
 * implements. Phase 1 (lib/dr-test-runner.ts) only ever ran
 * verifyStoredChecksum() + envelopeDecryptBackup() — no restore, no schema.
 * This module adds the one genuinely new piece of infrastructure Phase 2
 * needs: a throwaway, isolated Postgres schema to restore a decrypted
 * backup into, so restore is actually exercised (not just decrypt) without
 * ever touching a real user's rows.
 *
 * Why a dedicated pg.Client and not the app's `pool` (design doc §1):
 * `SET search_path` is session-scoped. A `Pool` hands out whichever
 * connection happens to be free, and — critically — recycles connections
 * between unrelated queries, so a `search_path` set on a pooled connection
 * would leak onto the next arbitrary query on that connection once
 * released. A single dedicated `pg.Client` (its own real connection, never
 * returned to any pool) is the only way to make `SET search_path` reliably
 * sticky for the whole lifetime of one DR test run, and to guarantee it
 * cannot bleed into unrelated production queries.
 *
 * Why the production MIGRATIONS array can just be re-run here, unmodified:
 * see lib/schema-migrations.ts's own header — none of its CREATE TABLE
 * statements schema-qualify their table names, so pointing `search_path` at
 * an isolated schema before running them recreates the whole table set
 * there, in isolation, with no separate migration script to maintain.
 *
 * Lifecycle for one DR test run (see lib/dr-test-runner.ts):
 *   const iso = await createIsolatedSchema(testId);
 *   try {
 *     ... await applyRestoreDiff(userId, snapshot, { dbOverride: iso.db }) ...
 *     ... SELECT COUNT(*) against iso.db per restored table ...
 *   } finally {
 *     await dropIsolatedSchema(iso);   // ALWAYS runs, even on failure
 *   }
