 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 1, Phase 2C: Client & Redirect URI Validation.
 *
 * Layers on top of Phase 2A-c's read-only registry access
 * (`getOidcClientById()` in `./oidc-clients`) the two checks the roadmap's
 * 2C task list asks for:
 *   - 2C-a: reject an unknown `client_id`.
 *   - 2C-b/2C-c: require the caller's `redirect_uri` to be an EXACT match
 *     against one of that client's registered `redirect_uris` — a
 *     path/scheme/host/query difference is a different string and must
 *     fail, not a "close enough" pass.
 *   - 2C-d: a consistent internal result shape for both checks (see
 *     `OidcClientValidationResult` / `OidcRedirectUriValidationResult`
 *     below) instead of two ad-hoc booleans or thrown exceptions.
 *
 * Scope discipline (this is 2C, not 2D/2E):
 *   - No scope parsing/allowed-scope checking — that is Phase 2D.
 *   - No unified `validateClientRequest(client_id, redirect_uri, scope)`
 *     combining this file's two checks with 2D's — that is Phase 2E-a.
 *     This file provides the two pieces 2E-a will compose, not the
 *     composition itself.
 *   - Nothing here is wired into `/oidc/authorize` or any route yet — that
 *     route doesn't exist until Phase 3.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * UPDATE — Season 4, Phase 8c: Pending/Unverified State + Abuse Prevention.
 *
 * `validateOidcClientId()` below now also rejects a client whose
 * `registrationStatus` (migration 091) isn't `'approved'` — a `'pending'`
 * (freshly dynamically-registered via Phase 8a, awaiting Phase 9d's
 * not-yet-built admin approval) or `'suspended'` client is treated
 * EXACTLY like an unknown `client_id`: same `invalid_client` result, no
 * new error code. This was a deliberate choice, not the path of least
 * resistance:
 *   - This function is the ONE place both `/oidc/authorize`
 *     (`lib/oidc-authorize-request.ts` -> `lib/oidc-client-request-validation.ts`
 *     -> here) and `/oidc/token` (`lib/oidc-token-client-auth.ts` -> here)
 *     resolve a `client_id` through. Adding the check here, once, covers
 *     both endpoints — 8c's own roadmap text names both explicitly
 *     ("`/oidc/authorize`/`/oidc/token` এই status-এ থাকা client-কে
 *     reject করে") — with no changes needed to either route or to
 *     `oidc-token-client-auth.ts`/`oidc-client-request-validation.ts`'s
 *     own composition logic.
 *   - Reusing `invalid_client` rather than inventing a distinct
 *     `unauthorized_client` result was the safety-driven choice: this
 *     function only knows the `client_id`, not yet whether the caller's
 *     `redirect_uri` is one this client actually registered. A NEW
 *     error code here would tempt a caller (`/oidc/authorize`'s route) to
 *     redirect the user-agent back to that client's `redirect_uri` with
 *     `?error=unauthorized_client` — exactly the "redirect to an
 *     unverified target" hazard this same file's header already warns
 *     against for `invalid_client` generally. Collapsing "pending"/
 *     "suspended" into the SAME `invalid_client` result this function
 *     already returns for "unknown client_id" means every existing
 *     caller's existing "don't redirect on invalid_client" handling
 *     already does the right thing here too, with zero new branches to
 *     get wrong.
 *
 * WHY REDIRECT URI VALIDATION IS ITS OWN ERROR, NOT `invalid_request`
 * The roadmap's global error model (section 4) lists standard OAuth/OIDC
 * error codes — `invalid_client`, `invalid_request`, etc. — that Phase 3's
 * `/oidc/authorize` will eventually send back to the CLIENT by redirecting
 * the user-agent to its `redirect_uri` with `?error=...` appended. That
 * mechanism is unsafe for exactly one failure: an unrecognized or
 * mismatched `redirect_uri`. If the server can't first confirm the
 * supplied `redirect_uri` is one the client actually registered, it must
 * not redirect the user-agent there at all — doing so would let anyone
 * redirect a victim to an arbitrary attacker-controlled URL just by
 * appending `&error=invalid_request`. RFC 6749 section 4.1.2.1 calls this
 * out explicitly for the same reason.
 *
 * So `"invalid_redirect_uri"` is kept as its own distinct internal error
 * value here, separate from `"invalid_client"` (which IS one of the
 * global error model's codes, since an unknown client is safe to reject
 * with a directly-rendered response — there's no verified redirect target
 * to redirect back to either way). How Phase 3's authorization endpoint
 * ultimately renders each of these two (redirect vs. a directly-rendered
 * error page) is that phase's call — this file only needs to make the two
 * failure cases distinguishable to whatever calls it.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * UPDATE — Season 4, Phase 8e: Client configuration management token
 * (RFC 7592-স্কোপড-ডাউন).
 *
 * New `validateOidcClientRegistrationAccessToken()` below — a THIRD,
 * independent validator alongside this file's existing client-id and
 * redirect-uri checks, for a route (`GET/PUT /oidc/register/:client_id`)
 * that never redirects a user-agent anywhere at all. See that function's
 * own doc comment for why it uses a distinct `invalid_token` error rather
 * than reusing `invalid_client`.

/**
 * 2C-b/2C-c: Redirect URI Exact Matching / Reject Near-Matches.
 *
 * Pure function — takes an already-validated `client` (e.g. from
 * `validateOidcClientId()`) rather than a `clientId`, so it never makes
 * its own DB call and is trivially unit-testable without a database.
 *
 * Exact string equality against `client.redirectUris` is deliberate and
 * sufficient to satisfy 2C-c's "reject near-matches" requirement for
 * every listed case:
 *   - path difference   ("/callback" vs "/callback/extra")   -> different string, no match.
 *   - scheme difference ("https://" vs "http://")            -> different string, no match.
 *   - host difference   ("sylo.ayzen.tech" vs "evil.tech",
 *                         or "sylo.ayzen.tech" vs
 *                         "sylo.ayzen.tech.evil.com")        -> different string, no match.
 *   - query difference  ("?x=1" vs no query, or "?x=2")      -> different string, no match.
 * No normalization is performed on either side (no trailing-slash
 * trimming, no case-folding, no query-param re-ordering, no percent-
 * decoding) — normalizing before comparison is exactly how open-redirect
 * bugs get introduced (RFC 6749's rationale for requiring exact matching).
 * A registered redirect URI that needs a variant (trailing slash, a dev
 * origin, etc.) must be registered as its own explicit array entry — that
 * is the registry's (Phase 2A/2B's) job, not this function's.
