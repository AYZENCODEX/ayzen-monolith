 * lib/oidc-token-introspection.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 5, Phase 10a: Introspection Endpoint (RFC
 * 7662-scoped-down) — the lookup/classification half.
 *
 * "Given a token string an authenticated client handed us, is it active,
 * and if so, whose is it and what does it grant" — this file's only job.
 * `routes/oidc-introspect.ts` (10a's route half) does the parsing (via
 * `lib/oidc-introspection-request.ts`) and client authentication (via
 * `lib/oidc-token-client-auth.ts`, reused as-is — see that file's own
 * header) before ever calling in here; this file receives an
 * already-authenticated caller's `client_id` and the raw token string,
 * nothing else.
 *
 * NO NEW VERIFICATION/STORAGE LOGIC — TWO EXISTING PRIMITIVES, COMPOSED
 * This provider has exactly two kinds of bearer secret a client could be
 * asking about:
 *   - an access token — `verifyOidcAccessToken()` (Phase 4c-a,
 *     `lib/oidc-access-token-verification.ts`) already proves signature/
 *     issuer/expiry/kid and extracts `sub`/`scope`/`aud`; Phase 10a's own
 *     update to that file (see its header) additionally exposes `exp`/
 *     `iat`, the two claims this file needs that 4c-a's original callers
 *     (`GET /oidc/userinfo`, `GET /oidc/resource/*`) never did.
 *   - a refresh token — `lookupRefreshToken()` (Phase 3e-d,
 *     `lib/oidc-refresh-tokens.ts`) already proves persistence and
 *     returns `clientId`/`userId`/`scopes`/`expiresAt`/`revokedAt`;
 *     `isRefreshTokenExpired()` (3e-b, same file) already answers the one
 *     policy question this file would otherwise have to re-derive.
 * This file adds no third way to mint, store, or verify either artifact —
 * it is a read-only classifier sitting on top of both, exactly the
 * "lib composes, doesn't reinvent" discipline the rest of this roadmap
 * already follows (`routes/oidc-token.ts` composing 3c-b..3e-c is the
 * clearest existing precedent for this same shape).
 *
 * `revoked_at` — READ HERE FOR THE FIRST TIME, WRITTEN BY NOBODY YET
 * `lib/oidc-refresh-tokens.ts`'s own header already documents that
 * nothing in this codebase writes `revoked_at` yet (that's Phase 10b's
 * job). This file reads it anyway (`stored.revokedAt !== null` counts as
 * inactive) purely so that the moment 10b starts writing it, 10a's
 * response is correct with no code change here — the identical
 * forward-compatible-reader posture `lib/oidc-client-validation.ts`'s
 * `validateOidcClientId()` already took reading `registration_status`
 * before Phase 9's approval workflow existed to ever set it away from
 * `'pending'`.
 *
 * WHY A TOKEN'S OWN `client_id`/`aud` MUST MATCH THE INTROSPECTING CLIENT
 * RFC 7662 itself does not mandate this (§2.1 only requires the caller to
 * be an "authorized protected resources" — it leaves what "authorized"
 * means to the deployment). This provider has no separate "resource
 * server" identity distinct from "OIDC client" (every caller of this
 * endpoint authenticates the same way `/oidc/token` callers do, via
 * `lib/oidc-token-client-auth.ts`) and no scope/role that would mark one
 * client as trusted to inspect another's tokens. Absent that concept,
 * letting any authenticated client introspect ANY other client's token
 * would turn this endpoint into exactly the kind of cross-client oracle
 * `lib/oidc-token-client-auth.ts`'s own header already refuses to build
 * for "does this client_id exist" — except worse, because the thing being
 * leaked here would be a real user's session activity (still-valid
 * tokens, their scopes, their expiry) rather than a boolean. So: a
 * syntactically/cryptographically valid token whose own `client_id`
 * doesn't match the authenticated caller is reported `{ active: false }`,
 * identical to a token that doesn't exist at all — RFC 7662 §2.2 itself
 * blesses exactly this non-distinction ("the authorization server MAY
 * respond ... with an HTTP 200 ... {\"active\": false}" for a token it
 * chooses not to describe further, no separate error code required).
 *
 * Scope discipline (this is 10a, not 10b/10c/10d/10e):
 *   - Read-only. Nothing here revokes, deletes, or mutates any row —
 *     `POST /oidc/revoke` (10b) is a separate, not-yet-built endpoint;
 *     this file's only effect on the system is a log line.
 *   - No cascade-by-client, no backchannel logout (10c/10d) — this file
 *     answers one token's question, not "every token this client/user
 *     pair holds."
 *   - No discovery-metadata change (10e) — `/.well-known/openid-configuration`
 *     advertising `introspection_endpoint` is that sub-phase's own,
 *     separate, single-line addition once this endpoint exists to
 *     advertise; not done in this pass (see this pass's own CHANGES file).
