 * lib/dr-test-runner.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * DR Evidence Collector — Phase 1 (Backup Integrity) + Phase 2
 * (Schema-Isolated Restore). See dr-evidence-collector-design.md for the
 * full multi-phase design this is Phase 1+2 of.
 *
 * Runs, in order, every check that doesn't need a user-typed password:
 *   1. Checksum verify — verifyStoredChecksum() (routes/vault-snapshot.ts),
 *      already used by the download/restore-preview paths, just called here
 *      as an evidence-generating step instead of inline in a request.
 *   2. Decrypt — envelopeDecryptBackup() (vault/crypto/backup-envelope.ts). The
 *      decrypted plaintext is parsed to JSON so restore (step 3) can run
 *      against it, but is NEVER logged, returned, or persisted anywhere
 *      beyond this function's own local variables — dropped as soon as the
 *      run finishes (pass or fail).
 *   3. Restore into an isolated schema (Phase 2, lib/dr-test-db.ts) —
 *      createIsolatedSchema() stands up a throwaway dr_test_<run_id>
 *      schema with the full production table set, applyRestoreDiff() (with
 *      a dbOverride pointed at that schema) restores the decrypted
 *      snapshot into it, and a table-by-table record-count comparison
 *      (snapshot array lengths vs. isolated-schema SELECT COUNT(*))
 *      confirms nothing silently got lost. The schema is ALWAYS dropped in
 *      a `finally`, whether or not everything before it succeeded.
 *
 * Per dr-evidence-collector-design.md §0, this only ever tests envelope-mode
 * (scheduled) snapshots. Password-mode backups need a user-typed password
 * nothing automated has access to — that stays a manual, owner-triggered
 * check, untouched here.
 *
 * The node-cron scheduler + admin dashboard + alerting + hash chain
 * (Phase 3) are deliberately NOT part of this module — see the design
 * doc's phased rollout plan (§8). This module is called today only by an
 * admin's manual "Run DR Test" action (routes/dr-tests.ts).
