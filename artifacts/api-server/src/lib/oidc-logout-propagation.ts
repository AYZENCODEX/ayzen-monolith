/**
 * lib/oidc-logout-propagation.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 3, Phase 6e-a: Propagation Interface.
 *
 * Phase 6d (see `CHANGES_OIDC_LOGOUT_PROPAGATION_DECISION_PHASE6D.md`)
 * chose OIDC Back-Channel Logout 1.0 for propagating a logout from this
 * provider to Sylo (and, per that doc's Decision Record, to any other
 * first-party client later, without the model itself needing to change).
 * This file is 6e-a's own scope, and ONLY 6e-a's:
 *
 *   "Create a clean abstraction" — nothing here dispatches a real HTTP
 *   request, nothing here reads `oidc_clients` for a real
 *   `backchannel_logout_uri` (that column does not exist yet — Phase
 *   6d-c's own "যা মাথায় রাখতে হবে" note), and nothing here is wired into
 *   `routes/oidc-logout.ts`, `routes/auth.ts`, or the Security page's
 *   revoke handlers.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   `buildLogoutTokenClaims()` / `issueOidcLogoutToken()` — pure claim
 *   assembly + RS256 signing, the exact same split
 *   `buildIdTokenClaims()`/`issueOidcIdToken()` (`lib/oidc-id-token.ts`,
 *   Phase 4a) already established: same active keypair
 *   (`getActiveKeypair()`), same published-JWKS trust chain (Phase 1e) a
 *   receiving RP would verify against, same "pure builder takes an
 *   explicit `now`, signer is a thin wrapper around it" discipline.
 *
 *   `propagateBackchannelLogout()` — the propagation interface itself,
 *   built around ONE injected effectful boundary (`deliver`), following
 *   this codebase's own "inject the effectful boundary" convention —
 *   `CHANGES_OIDC_LOGOUT_SESSION_PHASE6A_6C.md`'s design note on
 *   `resolveClient` (`lib/oidc-logout-request.ts`) is the most recent
 *   precedent for exactly this shape. `deliver` is REQUIRED, never
 *   defaulted to a real `fetch()` call — there is no real registered
 *   `backchannel_logout_uri` to call yet (see above), so a default
 *   implementation would have nothing real to do and nothing real to be
 *   tested against. 6e-b supplies both the real `deliver` and the real
 *   per-client target resolution once `oidc_clients.backchannel_logout_uri`
 *   exists.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * UPDATE — Season 3, Phase 6e-b: Sylo Integration.
 *
 * Added below, appended after 6e-a's own content (left otherwise
 * unchanged — every function above this note is exactly what 6e-a shipped):
 *   - `resolveBackchannelLogoutTargets()` — the real target lookup 6e-a's
 *     header said didn't exist yet, backed by migration 085's
 *     `oidc_clients.backchannel_logout_uri` column via
 *     `lib/oidc-clients.ts`'s `listBackchannelLogoutTargets()`.
 *   - `deliverBackchannelLogoutOverHttp` — the real `OidcBackchannelLogoutDeliverFn`
 *     6e-a deliberately left undefaulted; a single-attempt HTTP POST, no
 *     retry (retry/backoff is still 6e-c's own scope, not started here).
 *   - `dispatchBackchannelLogoutForUser()` — the one function every
 *     session-revoking call site in the codebase now calls
 *     (`routes/auth.ts`, `routes/oidc-logout.ts`), userId-scoped per this
 *     file's own `OidcLogoutTokenBinding.sid` design (still `null` on
 *     every call — this provider does not populate a `sid` on the
 *     sending side, see that field's own doc comment above).
 *
 * Still NOT this file's scope after 6e-b (unchanged from 6e-a's own list):
 *   - No `oidc.backchannel_logout.*` metrics/alerting beyond the
 *     `logger.info`/`logger.warn`/`logger.error` calls in this file —
 *     structured dashboards/alerting is 6e-d (Monitoring).
 *   - No resolution of "which of Sylo's OWN `user_sessions` rows a given
 *     Logout Token's `sub` maps to" — that is the RECEIVING side's job,
 *     `lib/oidc-backchannel-logout-receive.ts` (Sylo's own
 *     `routes/oidc-backchannel-logout.ts` endpoint), a separate file this
 *     one only ever sends to, never reads from.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * UPDATE — Season 3, Phase 6e-c: Failure Handling.
 *
 * Both 6e-a's and 6e-b's own headers above deliberately reserved this
 * exact scope for later: `OidcBackchannelLogoutDeliveryResult`'s own doc
 * comment says "Deliberately has no `attempt`/`retryAfter`-style fields
 * yet — that's 6e-c's own shape to add"; `deliverBackchannelLogoutOverHttp`'s
 * says "Retry/backoff policy is explicitly 6e-c's own scope, not
 * speculated in this function." This section is that scope, appended
 * after 6e-b's own content the same way 6e-b was appended after 6e-a's —
 * every function above this note is exactly what 6e-a/6e-b shipped,
 * unmodified, except `dispatchBackchannelLogoutForUser()` itself, whose
 * failure branches now call `enqueueBackchannelLogoutRetry()` below
 * instead of only logging and dropping the event.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MISSING BEFORE THIS
 *   `dispatchBackchannelLogoutForUser()` made exactly ONE HTTP POST
 *   attempt per registered target. On failure (network error, non-2xx, or
 *   an unexpected thrown error) it logged a `logger.warn` and moved on —
 *   no durable record survived a process restart, so a Sylo outage (a
 *   deploy, a restart, a transient network blip) at the wrong moment
 *   permanently desynced that user's Sylo session from their actual
 *   Central logout/revoke, with nothing anywhere recording that it
 *   happened.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SECTION ADDS
 *   A durable retry queue, deliberately mirroring `lib/mail-send-queue.ts`'s
 *   own proven shape (migrations 047/048) rather than inventing a second
 *   retry convention in this codebase — durable table (migration 087) +
 *   `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` claim + exponential backoff with jitter +
 *   stale-lock/startup crash recovery + give-up-after-N-attempts:
 *     - `enqueueBackchannelLogoutRetry()` — called by
 *       `dispatchBackchannelLogoutForUser()` ONLY when the inline first
 *       attempt fails (never on success — a durable row would have
 *       nothing left to do). Itself never throws.
 *     - `nextBackchannelLogoutRetryDelay()` — pure backoff calculation,
 *       exported so tests can assert its shape without a live DB, same
 *       split `computeAuthorizationCodeExpiry()`-style pure helpers in
 *       this codebase already keep from their DB-touching callers.
 *     - `runBackchannelLogoutQueueSweep()` — one worker tick: claim due
 *       rows, retry each via the SAME `deliverBackchannelLogoutOverHttp`
 *       boundary the inline first attempt already uses (re-used, not
 *       re-implemented), back off on failure, move to `dead_letter` after
 *       `MAX_BACKCHANNEL_LOGOUT_ATTEMPTS`.
 *     - `startBackchannelLogoutQueueWorker()` — registered in `index.ts`
 *       alongside `startSendQueueWorker()`, the same "one `cron.schedule`
 *       call per durable queue" convention this codebase already uses for
 *       every other durable queue/cron it has.
 *
 * WHY A DURABLE TABLE, NOT AN IN-PROCESS RETRY (e.g. `setTimeout`)
 *   An in-memory retry dies with the process — the exact same durability
 *   gap `lib/mail-send-queue.ts`'s own header describes for the pre-
 *   Phase-1 inline send path it replaced. A deploy/restart landing between
 *   a failed first attempt and its in-memory retry would silently lose
 *   the retry entirely, defeating the entire point of "Failure Handling."
 *
 * WHY EACH RETRY MINTS A FRESH LOGOUT TOKEN, NOT A STORED ONE
 *   `LOGOUT_TOKEN_TTL_SECONDS` is 2 minutes — a Logout Token is a live,
 *   short-TTL event notification, not a credential meant to be replayed
 *   later (see that constant's own doc comment, and
 *   `lib/oidc-backchannel-logout-receive.ts`'s header: the receiving side
 *   DOES enforce `exp`, unlike an `id_token_hint`). A backoff-delayed
 *   retry running minutes after the original failure would be replaying
 *   an already-expired token if one were stored. So the queue table
 *   (migration 087) stores the BINDING a retry needs to remint one
 *   (`user_id`, `client_id`, `backchannel_logout_uri`), never a signed
 *   JWT string — `processBackchannelLogoutQueueRow()` calls
 *   `issueOidcLogoutToken()` fresh on every attempt, exactly like the
 *   inline first attempt does via `propagateBackchannelLogout()`.
 *
 * WHY DEAD-LETTER, NOT "RETRY FOREVER"
 *   A target that is permanently gone (Sylo decommissioned, its
 *   `backchannel_logout_uri` rotated without the corresponding
 *   `oidc_clients` row being updated) would otherwise accumulate an
 *   unbounded number of queue rows retried forever.
 *   `MAX_BACKCHANNEL_LOGOUT_ATTEMPTS` bounds this the same way
 *   `MAX_SEND_ATTEMPTS` bounds `lib/mail-send-queue.ts`'s own retries —
 *   once the last attempt fails, the row moves to a terminal
 *   `'dead_letter'` status instead of continuing to retry, logged via
 *   `logger.error`/`logBus.error` as a REQUIRES-ATTENTION event (6e-d's
 *   future dashboards/alerting, not built here, would key off this exact
 *   status column rather than parsing log lines).
 *
 * WHY THE SNAPSHOT `backchannel_logout_uri` IS NOT RE-RESOLVED PER RETRY
 *   A queued row retries against the URI captured at enqueue time, not a
 *   fresh `oidc_clients` lookup on every attempt. This keeps a single
 *   queued row's retry history aimed at the one target it was actually
 *   created for — if an operator rotates a client's registered URI mid-
 *   retry-window, the OLD queued rows finish (or dead-letter) against the
 *   URI that was live when they failed, and any NEW logout event created
 *   after the rotation naturally uses the new URI via
 *   `resolveBackchannelLogoutTargets()`'s always-fresh lookup. Re-
 *   resolving on every retry would also reopen a subtler bug: a client
 *   that unregisters entirely (`backchannel_logout_uri` set back to
 *   `NULL`) would make a live re-lookup return nothing, and a naive
 *   "skip this attempt, but don't dead-letter it either" branch would
 *   need inventing — a fixed snapshot avoids that with no added shape.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SECTION DELIBERATELY IS NOT (still not this phase's scope)
 *   - No admin UI/endpoint to list or manually replay dead-lettered rows.
 *     Not asked for by 6e-c's own task list ("define safe behavior when
 *     propagation fails") — `lib/mail-send-queue.ts`'s own dead-letter
 *     equivalent (Drafts) is a surface the user already has for other
 *     reasons; this queue has no such existing surface to piggyback on.
 *   - No structured `oidc.backchannel_logout.*` metrics/dashboards beyond
 *     the `logger`/`logBus` calls this section adds — 6e-d (Monitoring).
 *   - No change to `dispatchBackchannelLogoutForUser()`'s own userId-
 *     scoped, one-event-per-registered-client shape, or to any of the
 *     three call sites that invoke it — this section only changes what
 *     happens AFTER a delivery attempt fails, nothing about when one is
 *     triggered.

 * instead of zero-or-many.
 *
 * Same "swallow every failure, never re-throw" contract as

// এর জন্য structured metrics/dashboards/alerting (এই পাসে শুধু logger/logBus

//
// SHAPE PRECEDENT: `lib/oidc-login-attempts.ts` (Phase 5c-d/5e-a/5e-b/5e-c)
// is the most recent "stats + health-threshold" pair in this roadmap, and
// `routes/admin-oidc-rollout.ts`'s GET handler is its one consumer. This
// section mirrors that exact split — `getBackchannelLogoutQueueStats()` is
// the stats side, `computeBackchannelLogoutQueueHealth()` /
// `evaluateBackchannelLogoutQueueHealth()` is the pure-calculation /
// effectful-wrapper pair `evaluateOidcRolloutHealth()` already establishes
// — but the underlying data source is different on purpose: login attempts
// have no durable table (an in-memory ring buffer is genuinely the right
// tradeoff there, per that file's own "WHY IN-MEMORY, NOT A TABLE" note),
// while the backchannel-logout queue is ALREADY a durable Postgres table
// (migration 087, 6e-c) — so there is no separate in-memory tally to
// maintain here. "Metrics" for this queue just means "query the table
// that's already the source of truth," the same way `routes/admin-wallet.ts`-
// style admin reads elsewhere in this codebase are thin aggregates over an
// existing table, not a parallel counter.
//
// WHY THE HEALTH CHECK ALSO WATCHES PENDING BACKLOG AGE, NOT JUST
// dead_letter COUNT: a dead_letter row means "we tried and gave up" — a
// real per-target failure. But a worker that silently stopped ticking
// (`startBackchannelLogoutQueueWorker()` never got called, or a deploy
// dropped the cron) would produce ZERO dead_letter rows — every row would
// just sit in 'pending' forever, looking identical to "queue is empty and
// healthy" unless something inspects HOW LONG the oldest pending row has
// been waiting. This is the exact "silence looks like nothing to report"
// gap `vault/infrastructure/backup/alerts.ts`'s own `alertUserOfMissedBackup()` header
// describes for its own watchdog case — same shape, applied to this queue.
