/**
 * lib/oidc-client-admin-audit.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 5, Phase 9e: Audit Log.
 *
 * Read/write layer over `oidc_client_admin_audit_log` (migration 093) — see
 * that migration's own header for the full "why this shape, why not a
 * Drizzle schema, why `client_id` isn't an FK" reasoning. This file is the
 * one and only writer/reader of that table.
 *
 * `logOidcClientAdminAudit()` is `routes/admin-oidc-clients.ts`'s own new
 * caller on EVERY 9b/9c/9d write (`PATCH .../:clientId`, `POST
 * /admin/oidc-clients`, `DELETE .../:clientId`, `PATCH .../:clientId/status`)
 * — exactly 9e's own roadmap text ("প্রতিটা 9b/9c/9d action-এ একটা রো"). It
 * is NOT called from `lib/oidc-client-admin.ts`'s own persistence
 * functions themselves — same "route composes several effects, lib
 * persists one thing" split this roadmap's every earlier OIDC route/lib
 * pair already uses (see `lib/oidc-user-consents.ts`'s own header for the
 * closest precedent: `revokeConsent()` doesn't dispatch backchannel logout
 * either, its caller route does). Composing "did the write succeed, THEN
 * also audit-log it" is the route's job, not this file's or
 * `lib/oidc-client-admin.ts`'s.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, NEVER THROWS — same discipline `vault/infrastructure/backup/audit.ts`'s
 * `logBackupAudit()` already establishes for this codebase's other
 * dedicated audit trail: an audit-log write failing must never fail, delay,
 * or roll back the admin action that triggered it. A dropped audit row on a
 * transient DB hiccup is a (logged) gap in the trail, not an outage in the
 * admin UI.
 *
 * `before`/`after` snapshots passed in by the route are expected to already
 * be sanitized (i.e. `serializeOidcClientForAdmin()`'s own projection,
 * which already omits `clientSecretHash`/`registrationAccessTokenHash` —
 * see that function's own header) — this file does not itself strip
 * anything from what it's handed, the same "trusts its caller's already-
 * validated input" posture `grantConsent()` (`lib/oidc-user-consents.ts`)
 * takes for ITS caller's already-validated scopes. There is exactly one
 * caller of this function in this codebase (`routes/admin-oidc-clients.ts`)
 * and it is responsible for never handing this a raw, unsanitized
 * `OidcClient`.

 * union, not a DB CHECK constraint (see migration 093's own header on this
 * exact choice), is authoritative: adding a new admin write path in a
 * future phase means adding a new member here, not a migration.
