/**
 * services/credit-meter.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PHASE 5 — AYZEN Credits consumption layer.
 *
 * What this is: the single place that turns a "metered action" (an AI query
 * in Zynth, an automation run in Skarn, a boosted listing in Verve, a
 * custom-routed send in Wisp, a premium widget hit from Astra, an advanced
 * report export in Ryft) into a credit deduction — reusing the exact
 * `credits` / `credit_transactions` tables and atomic-update pattern that
 * `routes/credits.ts` already uses for /credits/swap and
 * /credits/buy-subscription, instead of inventing a second billing system.
 *
 * Design (see ayzen-workspace-master-plan.md §5):
 *  - Tiers are NOT feature walls. Every action below is available to every
 *    user; it just costs credits. Core/free-tier functionality for each app
 *    (viewing the vault, basic wallet, basic mail, basic listings, manual
 *    Skarn monitoring) is never metered here and never gated on balance.
 *  - AYZEN Credits and AZN stay separate concepts (§5, Risk Register #2) —
 *    this file only ever debits/credits the `balance` column (credits), the
 *    same column /credits/purchase and /credits/swap already move. It never
 *    touches `aznBalance`.
 *  - "Hard stop" behavior (§5): when balance can't cover an action's cost,
 *    the request is rejected with a 402 + a clear "out of credits" body the
 *    frontend can turn into a one-tap top-up prompt (reusing
 *    POST /credits/purchase) — the metered action simply doesn't run.
 *
 * Two-step pattern used by every integration point below:
 *   1. `requireCreditBalance(actionKey)` — route middleware, runs AFTER
 *      requireAuth. Pre-flight balance check only (no deduction yet), so a
 *      request that's going to fail validation/auth for other reasons never
 *      touches the ledger.
 *   2. `chargeCredits(userId, actionKey)` — called by the route handler
 *      itself, once the metered action has actually succeeded (AI reply
 *      generated, report actually built, mail actually sent). This is a
 *      charge-on-success model: a user is never billed for an action that
 *      failed downstream (upstream AI provider error, SMTP failure, etc).
 *      `chargeCredits` re-checks balance atomically at charge time (same
 *      `WHERE balance >= cost` pattern as /credits/swap) so a balance that
 *      changed between the pre-flight check and the charge — e.g. a second
 *      concurrent request — still can't push a user negative.
 *
 * Costs below are a first pass, intentionally centralized in one exported
 * map so the pricing pass called out in the master plan (§8, open questions)
 * is a one-file edit, not a grep-and-replace across six apps. Also exposed
 * read-only via GET /credits (see routes/credits.ts) so the frontend can
 * show "costs 5 credits" next to a metered action before the user clicks it.
