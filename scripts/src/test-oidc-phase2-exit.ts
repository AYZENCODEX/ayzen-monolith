/**
 * scripts/src/test-oidc-phase2-exit.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 1, Phase 2E-e: Phase 2 Final Verification.
 *
 * Same shape as scripts/src/test-rotation-lifecycle.ts (1D-f): the one
 * integration test in this phase that wires together the REAL seed data
 * (`SEED_CLIENTS` from `./seed-oidc-clients`, Phase 2B) with the full
 * validation stack (Phase 2C/2D/2E), rather than synthetic `fakeClient()`
 * fixtures like every other oidc test-*.ts in this repo uses. Where
 * 2E-d's test-oidc-client-request-validation.ts already covers the full
 * combinatorial matrix (valid/invalid redirect × valid/invalid scope) in
 * the abstract, this file answers a narrower, concrete question: do the
 * FIVE ACTUAL first-party clients Phase 2B seeds pass their own
 * validation, and correctly reject each other's redirect URIs?
 *
 * The roadmap states Phase 2 is DONE when:
 *   - registry exists                 -> migration 079 (Phase 2A), unchanged since.
 *   - all first-party clients seeded  -> SEED_CLIENTS below, Phase 2B.
 *   - redirect URI validation works   -> validateOidcRedirectUri, Phase 2C, re-exercised below.
 *   - scope validation works         -> validateOidcScopes, Phase 2D, re-exercised below.
 *   - unified validator works        -> validateOidcClientRequestForClient, Phase 2E, re-exercised below.
 *   - tests pass                     -> this file, plus every earlier phase's own test-*.ts.
 * This file is the concrete evidence for the last four bullets, run
 * against real seed data instead of synthetic fixtures; the first bullet
 * is a schema/migration fact this file cannot itself re-verify (there is
 * no live DATABASE_URL in this sandbox to query — same limitation already
 * noted in every earlier DB-dependent oidc-*.ts test in this phase).
 *
 * NOTE ON IMPORTING SEED_CLIENTS: `seed-oidc-clients.ts` (2B) calls its
 * own `main()` unconditionally at module scope (matching every other
 * `scripts/src/*.ts` script in this repo — see e.g.
 * `retire-jwt-signing-keys.ts`'s identical `main().catch().finally()`
 * pattern), so simply importing `SEED_CLIENTS` from it — exactly as
 * `test-seed-oidc-clients.ts` (2B-f) already does — also fires that
 * `main()` in the background. With no `DATABASE_URL` in this environment
 * `main()`'s own per-client try/catch swallows the resulting DB error and
 * logs it per client; it does not throw, block this file's imports, or
 * affect any assertion below. This is a pre-existing property of 2B's
 * script (not something this sub-phase introduces or is in scope to
 * change) — flagged here only because this is the first time in this
 * roadmap's execution that a script actually importing `SEED_CLIENTS` has
 * been run for real rather than only reasoned about.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/src/test-oidc-phase2-exit.ts
