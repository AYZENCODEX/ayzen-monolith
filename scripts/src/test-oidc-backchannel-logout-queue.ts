/**
 * scripts/src/test-oidc-backchannel-logout-queue.ts
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * OIDC Roadmap — Season 3, Phase 6e-c tests.
 *
 * Covers `lib/oidc-logout-propagation.ts`'s 6e-c (Failure Handling)
 * addition — specifically `nextBackchannelLogoutRetryDelayMs()`, the one
 * piece of 6e-c that is pure/side-effect-free the same way
 * `test-oidc-logout-propagation.ts` (6e-a) tests
 * `buildLogoutTokenClaims()`/`propagateBackchannelLogout()` against a fake
 * in-memory `deliver` rather than a live DB.
 *
 * DB-DEPENDENT PARTS NOT EXERCISED HERE (same precedent
 * `test-oidc-clients.ts` and 6e-b's own `test-oidc-backchannel-logout-receive.ts`
 * already set for this codebase — "hand-verify against a live dev DB"):
 *   - `enqueueBackchannelLogoutRetry()` — a real `INSERT`.
 *   - `claimNextBackchannelLogoutBatch()` — a real `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
 *     transaction; needs concurrent connections to meaningfully test the
 *     no-double-claim guarantee at all.
 *   - `processBackchannelLogoutQueueRow()` — reads/writes real rows.
 *   - `recoverStaleBackchannelLogoutLocks()` /
 *     `recoverBackchannelLogoutQueueOnStartup()` — same.
 *   - `runBackchannelLogoutQueueSweep()` — composes all of the above.
 * Once a real dev `DATABASE_URL` is available: insert a row via
 * `enqueueBackchannelLogoutRetry()` pointed at a local HTTP listener that
 * fails N times then succeeds, run `runBackchannelLogoutQueueSweep()`
 * repeatedly, and assert the row's `status`/`attempts` progression ends at
 * `'delivered'`; separately, force `MAX_BACKCHANNEL_LOGOUT_ATTEMPTS`
 * consecutive failures and assert it ends at `'dead_letter'`.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINT (this pass): no network/`pnpm install` access in
 * this sandbox, so this script (like 6e-a's/6e-b's own test scripts before
 * it) has not actually been RUN here — it follows the same
 * `npx tsx scripts/src/...` convention and should be run for real in a dev
 * environment with `pnpm install` already done.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/src/test-oidc-backchannel-logout-queue.ts
